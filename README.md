**MyMate**

Your real-time, privacy-first screen assistant.

**✨ What is MyMate?**
“A voice-first AI assistant that lets users control their laptop screen, apps, and tasks — just like a teammate guiding you.”

Understands any screen content — PDFs, websites, videos, apps, docs, etc.

Uses vision, OCR, voice, and text to help in real time.

Works locally. No cloud. No spying.

**🎯 Who is it for?**
👩‍💻 Coders — ask questions, debug, or search without lifting your fingers.

👨‍🌾 Small-town learners — no tech knowledge? Speak, and it helps.

🎒 Students & travelers — offline or spotty internet? Still works.

🧑‍🏭 Workers & elders — don’t click or type. Just speak.

**🧩 Why MyMate Matters**
🖥️ No API? Doesn’t matter. It reads screen pixels.

🔐 No OAuth? Doesn’t matter. You don’t need their data.

🧍‍♀️ No privacy loss? Everything runs locally — nothing leaves your device.

🤖 Scalable trust model — each user gets their own private agent.

It’s democratized help — for everyone, everywhere, by design.
