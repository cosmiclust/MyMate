# MyMate
your real-time, privacy-first screen assistant.



**What it does:**

"A voice-first AI assistant that lets users control their laptop screen, apps, and tasks — just like a teammate guiding you."

**Who it's for:**

Coders, non-tech users, small-town learners, students, travelers, workers — everyone

**Why it matters:**

It removes the need to type, click, or even understand tech. It democratizes help.

*Apps don’t expose APIs?*  Doesn’t matter — you read screen pixels.

*No login/OAuth needed?* Doesn’t matter — you don’t need user data from them.

*Privacy?* Everything is local — no data shared unless user consents.

*Scalable trust model* — Everyone can have their own local agent. No one needs to “give” their data._
