Coders, non-tech users, small-town learners, students, travelers, workers — everyone

**Why it matters:**

It removes the need to type, click, or even understand tech. It democratizes help.

_Apps don’t expose APIs? Doesn’t matter — you read screen pixels.

No login/OAuth needed? Doesn’t matter — you don’t need user data from them.

Privacy? ✅ Everything is local — no data shared unless user consents.

Scalable trust model — Everyone can have their own local agent. No one needs to “give” their data._
